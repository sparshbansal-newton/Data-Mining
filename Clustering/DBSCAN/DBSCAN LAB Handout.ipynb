    "## 🧩 DBSCAN Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** is a **density-based** clustering algorithm that groups together points that are close to each other (dense regions) and labels points that lie alone in low-density regions as **noise (outliers)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN **does not require specifying the number of clusters (K)** and can find clusters of **arbitrary shape**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How DBSCAN Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Parameters**\n",
    "   - `eps`: The **maximum distance** between two points for them to be considered neighbors.\n",
    "   - `min_samples`: The **minimum number of points** required to form a dense region (a cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Classify Each Point**\n",
    "   - **Core Point** → Has at least `min_samples` neighbors within distance `eps`.\n",
    "   - **Border Point** → Not a core point but lies within `eps` of a core point.\n",
    "   - **Noise (Outlier)** → Neither a core nor a border point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering Process**\n",
    "   - Start from an unvisited point.\n",
    "   - If it’s a **core point**, create a new cluster and recursively include all reachable points.\n",
    "   - If it’s **noise**, mark it as outlier.\n",
    "   - Continue until all points are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically detects the **number of clusters**.  \n",
    "- Works well with **arbitrarily shaped clusters** (non-spherical).  \n",
    "- **Identifies outliers** naturally.  \n",
    "- Less sensitive to initialization than K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance can degrade in **high-dimensional data**.  \n",
    "- Requires careful tuning of `eps` and `min_samples`.  \n",
    "- Struggles with clusters of **varying densities**.\n",
