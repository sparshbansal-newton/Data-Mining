    "HELP International has raised around $10 million. The CEO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"country_data.csv\"`**, which includes various features. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `country`: Name of the country.\n",
    "  - `child_mort`: Child mortality rate, the number of deaths of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births.\n",
    "  - `exports`: Exports of goods and services as a percentage of the country's GDP.\n",
    "  - `health`: Health expenditure as a percentage of the country's GDP.\n",
    "  - `imports`: Imports of goods and services as a percentage of the country's GDP.\n",
    "  - `income`: Net income per person in USD.\n",
    "  - `inflation`: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling(%).\n",
    "  - `life_expec`: Life expectancy at birth, indicating the number of years a newborn is expected to live.\n",
    "  - `total_fer`: Total fertility rate, the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime.\n",
    "  - `gdpp`: GDP per capita in USD, representing the average economic output per person.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist / AI engineer, your task is to use this dataset to categorize / cluster the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country."
